# Hello Angular 2.0 (and Bootstrap 4.0)

This is just an experimental playground for feature updates to the Angular 2.0 framework. Currently the application is being developed using the WebStorm IDE. Webstorm handles the transpiling of the typescript and sass files for the project. If you are not using the Webstorm IDE you will need to transpile the typescript and scss files yourself or through another third-party plugin.

All of the server functionality is written using ES6 where appropriate. Because of this you may need to upgrade to a newer version of Node. See prerequisites below.

There is a live example of the code shown visit [http://helloangular2.herokuapp.com](http://helloangular2.herokuapp.com).

### Prerequisites

1. Node >= 5.9.0
2. Typings (installed globally)

### Installation

    $ npm install
    $ typings install
    
### Running

    $ npm start
